# Selected Machine Learning Projects (Data_Science_Portfolio)

## Project Overview

You are welcome to this machine learning repository which is a collection of selected projects spanning across different domains including the capital market (stock exchange), industrial sector (preventive maintenance), Visa processing, Sales, News Portal and Hospitality sector (Hotel bookings). Essentially, these projects demonstrate the classic capability of using machine learning algorithms in effectively predicting business outcomes given a set of input variables. The ability to make such informed prediction facilitates the making of strategic business decision thereby enhancing the overall business performance.

The table below gives a cursory view of all the projects present in this repository.

|Project Name| Project Description|Link
|:-----------:|:-------------------:|:-------:
|Clustering of stocks in stock market           |Clustering of stocks with similar characteristics using K-Means clustering and Hierarchical clustering algorithms. Concepts such as the elbow method, silhouette scores, cophenetic correlation were used to select the optimum number of clusters.                    |[Clustering of stocks](https://github.com/John-sam1983/John_Samson_Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/main/Clustering_Analysis_of_stock_market_data%20(Unsupervised_learning))))

This repository is a compilation of all the data science projects I have successfully carried out.
