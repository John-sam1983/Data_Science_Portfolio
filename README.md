# Selected Machine Learning Projects (Data_Science_Portfolio)

## Project Overview

You are welcome to this machine learning repository which is a collection of selected projects spanning across different domains including the capital market (stock exchange), industrial sector (preventive maintenance), Visa processing, Sales, News Portal and Hospitality sector (Hotel bookings). Essentially, these projects demonstrate the classic capability of using machine learning algorithms in effectively predicting business outcomes given a set of input variables. The ability to make such informed prediction facilitates the making of strategic business decision thereby enhancing the overall business performance.

# List of projects

The table below gives a cursory view of all the projects present in this repository.

|Project Name| Project Description|Link
|:-----------:|:-------------------:|:-------:
|**Clustering of stocks in stock market**           |Clustering of stocks with similar characteristics using K-Means clustering and Hierarchical clustering algorithms. Concepts such as the elbow method, silhouette scores, cophenetic correlation were used to select the optimum number of clusters.                    |[Clustering of stocks](https://github.com/John-sam1983/John_Samson_Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/main/Clustering_Analysis_of_stock_market_data%20(Unsupervised_learning))
|**Prediction of failures in machines**|This project used various classification models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Bagging, Extreme Gradient Boost to predict failures in generators. Hyperparameter tuning of the models were carried out and the best performing model was selected based on the given performance metrics|[Failure Prediction](https://github.com/John-sam1983/John_Samson_Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/main/Predicting_failures_in_wind_generators_for_preventive_maintenance)
|**Prediction of visa applicant to be certified**|This project attempt to build a model that is capable of predicting the visa applicant that stands a better chance to be certified among several applicants. Different classification models were used and the hyperparameters were tuned. The best performing model was selected based on the given performance metrics.|[Prediction of visa applicant](https://github.com/John-sam1983/John_Samson_Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/main/Machine_learning_model_for_predicting_candidates_with_high_chance_of_VISA_approval)
|**Machine Learning-based solution to predict hotel booking cancellation**|This project used the Decision Tree Classification model to predict the chance of a customer cancelling a hotel booking. The different variables significantly influence the customers to make such decisions were identified.|[Hotel Booking Cancellation](https://github.com/John-sam1983/John_Samson_Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/main/Predicting_Hotel_Booking_Cancellation)
|**ML-based solution to develop a dynamic pricing strategy for used and refurbished devices**|The project used linear regression algorithm to predict the price of used phones and tablets based on the selected input variables. Several statistical concepts were highlighted in the project such as  Multicollinearity test, Normality test, and test for homoscedasticity.|[Predict price of refurbished phones](https://github.com/John-sam1983/John_Samson_Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/main/Linear_Regression_Model_to_predict_price_of_used_phones)
